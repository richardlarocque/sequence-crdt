# sequence-crdt

This repository includes primitive implementations of some Sequence
[CRDT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type)s
and simple micro-benchmarks to compare them against each other.

Inlcudes [Logoot](https://hal.inria.fr/inria-00432368/document),
[LSEQ](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00921633/document), and a
less-well-known variant that I'm calling "unique position".

None of this code is intended for any serious use.  This is a reasearch project
driven by personal interest.
